# Web Scraping


Here i have performed Web Scraping using Selenium Automation Tool using Python,the proposed methodology for Web Scrapping was,first find get the table 
using the XPath Selectors and then accordingly select the `tr` and `td` from the tables,after the selection,we must enter the value of the selected component
into our default dict collection,i have mainted a default dict collection so that it is easy to convert that file into `json` format and then use that json
format with any frontend tool like ploty express,D3.js etc,after converting the files into json format i have converted them into csv files,so that it is easy
for data preprocessing and data merging,here is the proposed methodoly for it

Data has been scraped from : https://maharerait.mahaonline.gov.in/
